# About

<img src="../images/mathy_headshot.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200" style="padding-left: 10px" align =  "right" BR CLEAR=”left”>

I'm an in-coming postdoc in Lars Steinmetz's Lab at [Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/group/steinmetzlab/cgi-bin/wordpress/) and [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/groups/steinmetz/). I did my Ph.D in Bioengineering at UCSF and UC Berkeley, working with [Tanja Kortemme](http://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/). I used high throughput analysis of mutations, biophysical and biochemical characterization of proteins, and computational protein modeling to better understand and engineer protein function.

## Expertise

I've trained as a protein engineer, systems biologist, and computational biologist. My research seeks to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of mutations in cells - how can a small structural change in a protein undermine cellular homeostasis and even lead to disease? In my PhD I worked with yeast and characterized purified proteins for with biochemical and structural techniques. In the past I've worked with cell culture models of cancer to engineer better therapeutic proteins. I have extensive computational experience in R and Python for bioinformatics and Rosetta for protein modeling. In the future, I'm interested in how high-throughput, rich measurements of cell states can be used to guide protein engineering.

## Education
