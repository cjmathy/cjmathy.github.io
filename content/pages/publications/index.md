SARS-CoV-2 work, using Rosetta to predict the interaction interface between ORF6 and the Nup98-RAE1 complex. This prediction was later validated by other groups [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.234559v1.full) and [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/10/22/2016650117):

We have a new preprint describing our work on the GTPase switch Ran/Gsp1, currently out for review:

My previous work on growth factors was accepted as a Senior Thesis, and is currently being written up as part of a larger manuscript for submission to a peer-reviewed journal:
