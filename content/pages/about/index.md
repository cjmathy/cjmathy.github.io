I'm currently a Ph.D student in Bioengineering at UCSF and UC Berkeley. I work in the lab of [Dr. Tanja Kortemme](http://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/), where we use computational protein design, high throughput characterization of phenotypes, and traditional biophysics to better understand how we should make new proteins that do cool things.

__Expertise__

I do experimental and computational work to study proteins and their cellular functions.

My experimental work is currently done with yeast or purified proteins for biochemical and structural characterization. I've also worked with *in vitro* mammalian systems.


Computationally, I use Rosetta for protein modeling, Python for ODE modeling of molecular networks, and R and Python to analyze biochemical, structural, and 'omics' data.

__Education__

PhD (expected, 2021), Bioengineering, UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley

BS, Bioengineering with Honors, Stanford University, 2016
