I'm currently a Ph.D student in Bioengineering at UCSF and UC Berkeley. I work in the lab of [Dr. Tanja Kortemme](http://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/), where we use computational protein design, high throughput characterization of phenotypes, and traditional biophysics to better understand how we should make new proteins that do cool things.

__Expertise__

I do both experimental and computational work to design and study proteins and their cellular functions.

My experimental work is currently done both in yeast or with purified proteins for biochemical and structural characterization. I've also worked with mammalian *in vitro* systems.


Computationally, I use Rosetta for protein modeling, Python for ODE modeling of molecular circuits, and I analyze my biochemical, structural, and 'omics' data in R and Python.

__Education__

PhD (expected, 2021), Bioengineering, UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley

BS, Bioengineering with Honors, Stanford University, 2016
