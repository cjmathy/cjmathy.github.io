Welcome to the site! It's meant to be a landing page for my work as a bioengineer.

I'm a postdoc in Lars Steinmetz's Lab at [Stanford Genetics](https://web.stanford.edu/group/steinmetzlab/cgi-bin/wordpress/). I'm building experimental techniques and computational models to map the broad effects of mutations in cells, with the goal of harnessing these maps for synthetic biology. I also work on re-engineering mitochondria with some fantastic colleagues - check us out at [Powerhouse](https://www.powerhouse.bio/). I did my Ph.D work in Bioengineering with [Tanja Kortemme](http://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/) at [UCSF](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/bioe), using mutations to uncover how allostery enables one protein to multitask, regulating several distinct cellular pathways simultaneously.

Although proteins act at the molecular scale, they're part of a vast network in the cell. I study the ripple effect by which small structural changes in proteins can undermine the health of cells, tissues, and entire organisms. This research question spans multiple biological scales, and so my background has been multidisciplinary: systems biology, biochemistry and structural biology, protein modeling, and protein engineering.
